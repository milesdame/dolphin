    "Heart": "A four-chambered heart, similar to other mammals, pumping blood throughout the dolphin's body.",
    "Stomach": "Dolphins have a multi-chambered stomach to digest different types of food.",
    "Larynx": "The larynx in dolphins allows them to produce sounds used in communication and echolocation.",
    "Pelvis": "A small, vestigial pelvis is present, a remnant of their land-dwelling ancestors.",
    "Spinal Column": "The spinal column provides structural support and flexibility, allowing agile movements in the water.",
