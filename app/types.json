They are one of the most well_studied marine mammals in the wild. Common bottlenose dolphins get their name from their short, thick snout (or rostrum). They are generally gray in color.",

As Risso's dolphins age, their coloration lightens from black, dark gray, or brown to pale gray or almost white. Adult Risso's dolphins typically have distinct and heavy scarring.",

Spinner dolphins are relatively small compared with other species of oceanic dolphins. Spinner dolphins feed at night on species including small fish, shrimp, and squid. Spinner dolphins are especially threatened by human tourism activities.",

They usually occur in groups of several hundres to 1,000 and are quite social, often schooling with other species. These dolphins are at high risk of entanglement in fishing nets, as they often swim alongside tuna.",

They are capable of diving to at least 2,300 feet in search of their fish and cephalopod prey. They display a unique behavior called roto_tailing, when the animal leaps high out of the water and vigorously rotates its tail while airborne.",
